        <h2>
          Current Brews
        </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Frogtown IPA
  It took the brewmaster from Frogtown, OH (aka Cassella) a 12 year trek to the west coast to come up with this recipe - Frogtown IPA, It's Hoppy!
  6.1% ABV | 7 SRM Color | 45 IBU</li>

  <li>Moweizen
  This traditional German Ale has subtle fruity esters, most notably banana. Light and refreshing, you'll be asking for one Moweizen.
  5.0% ABV | 3 SRM Color | 13 IBU</li>

  <li>Wally Post RED
  Summer, baseball and beer! This American Red is brewed to have a complex malt backbone with a subtle rye spiciness to celebrate a local legend. Play ball!
  5.4% ABV | 14 SRM Color | 21 IBU</li>

  <li>Honeywagon IPA
  It's no load of manure - the aromatics of this Honeywagon has an eye-opening tropical mango-pineapple fruitiness. Honey malt sweetness provides enough body to accompany big hop flavors making this a refreshing American IPA. Cheers!
  6.6 ABV | 6 SRM Color | 50 IBU</li>

  <li>Marzen Oktoberfest
  ***On Tap September 14th*** Celebrate the fall season with our traditional Marzen Oktoberfest. Brewed to have a smooth and rich malty sweetness with a bitterness backbone to counter the sweetness. A dry finish and light ABV will let you enjoy this lager pint after pint, or litre after litre. Prost!
  5.3% ABV | 10 SRM Color | 26 IBU</li>

  <li>Black Bridge Smoked Porter
  A little smokey! Takes us back to that childhood spot underneath the Black Bridge on the banks of the Chickasaw. Enjoy its beechwood smoky aroma and flavors on top of a roasty malt body, finishing chocolaty bitter, then sweet. Delicious!
  5.4% ABV | 45 SRM Color | 38 IBU</li>

  <li>Buzzards Glory
  This golden colored ale is packed with a citrus thirst quench and finishes with a spicy rye note on the palate. Cheers!
  5.1% ABV | 7 SRM Color | 28 IBU</li>

  <li>Little Turtle IPA
  This seasonal wet-hopped American IPA features Cascade hops from Heartland Hops in Ft. Recovery, OH. Whole wet hop cones late in the boiling brew kettle and dry-hopped in the fermenter bring out piney and citrus aromas and flavors, balancing a biscuit malt flavor.
  5.5% ABV | 6 SRM Color | 42 IBU</li>

  <li>OH Helles
  Give me an O-H! Helles! This light, golden lager is brewed to be soft, bready and delicious. Lagered on top of Bavarian yeast, enjoy the delightful grassy aromas and sweet bready flavors. O-H! Helles!
  4.9% ABV | 3 SRM Color | 16 IBU</li>

  <li>Blackberry Prairie Wheat
  With blackberries from Cranberry Prairie, our Blackberry Prairie Wheat has a purple hue tint to a pillowy white head with a hint of blackberry fruitiness on the nose and finish. In between is a refreshing medium-bodied American Wheat Ale that can make one fall in love with beer, all over again. Take a hearty drink and enjoy!
  5.8% ABV | 11 SRM Color | 19 IBU</li>

  <li>Burbank Blonde
  This Blonde inspired me to take the leap into Craft Beer. Balancing simple country malt with Great Northwest Valley floral hops is what makes this beer so special. Enjoy!
  4.8 ABV | 3 SRM Color | 20 IBU</li>

  <li>Baked Oatmeal Stout
  A chocolate & coffee roasted grain flavor upfront accompanies a nutty, slightly sweet, and creamy finish. We toast the oats so you can raise your glass - Cheers!
  5.2% ABV | 35 SRM Color | 35 IBU</li>

  <li>Steineman Station Saison
  *** Returning October 19th*** Brewed with orange peel and coriander, it has a fragrantful spicy white head worth enjoying twice before that first quench. An addition of wheat malt helps fill the body, has pear to orange flavors, and finishes refreshingly smooth. This recipe was found with Steineman Station artifacts. All aboard!
  6.9% ABV | 4 SRM Color | 24 IBU</li>

  <li>Saisonâ€™s Greetings
  ***Out of Season*** Saison's Greeting! This Belgian Red spiced with cinnamon and ginger is a holiday treat. Big and warming, the sweet bold flavors of green apple and cinnamon bring you our Christmas Cheer.
  7.7% ABV | 18 SRM Color | 23 IBU</li>

  <li>Sawcreek Mosaic
  ***Out of Season***This Mosaic of an American Pale Ale has a slightly caramel malt body and a medium amount of bitterness. Plenty of late-in-the-boil hop additions of Mosaic give the beer a tropical fruity aroma and flavors, like mangos and pineapple. It's art for your tongue to enjoy. Cheers!
  5.5% ABV | 5 SRM Color | 27 IBU</li>

  <li>Sawcreek Pale
  *** Out of Season*** An American Pale Ale featuring Cascade and Centennial hop flavoring balanced by a caramel malt backbone. Brewed for you near the banks of Chickasaw Creek!
  5.2% ABV | 6 SRM Color | 25 IBU</li>
  Growlers - $7
</ul>

  <h2>GROWLER CARE:</h2>
  <p>Keep your beer cold and once the cap is removed, it's best to enjoy the beer within the next several hours. Rinse-out the growler as soon as practical. When you have time, soak in hot soapy water for a few minutes and use a brush to wash or shake vigorously. Drain and rinse out a couple of times. Turn the growler upside down to drain. Dry and store with the cap off. If your growler does not pass the quality control check (nose-check) when you bring it in, we'll wash it on the spot to ensure the quality of your beer.</p>
