  <h2>GROWLER CARE:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>  <b>Growlers - $7</b></li>
  <li>Keep your beer cold and once the cap is removed, it's best to enjoy the beer within the next several hours. Rinse-out the growler as soon as practical. When you have time, soak in hot soapy water for a few minutes and use a brush to wash or shake vigorously. Drain and rinse out a couple of times. Turn the growler upside down to drain. Dry and store with the cap off. If your growler does not pass the quality control check (nose-check) when you bring it in, we'll wash it on the spot to ensure the quality of your beer.</li>
