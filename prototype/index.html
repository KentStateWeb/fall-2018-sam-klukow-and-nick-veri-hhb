<h2>Our Brewhouse</h2>

<p>The brewhouse consists of a 7BBL boil kettle, custom mashtun, and 6 7BBL fermenters.</p>

<h2>Our Tap Room</h2>

<p>The Hopps House Tap Room was designed and built with craft beer in mind. We hope our guests find as much enjoyment as we do in gathering among friends and neighbors over a pint of beer.

Visit our tap room and see what’s on tap! Enjoy a fresh beer by the pint or a sampler glass. After you’ve decided which is your favorite beer, bring home a growler!
See what we have on tap and bring a half-gallon growler of beer home to enjoy. Bring in your growler for a re-fill, or buy a new one for $7.</p>

<h2>Featured This Month</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Pumpkin Farmhouse
***On Tap September 23rd*** Our Pumpkin Farmhouse brings the abundant fall pumpkins together with the nostalgic aromas of Thanksgiving. Our ale is a treat on the nose, brings a rich and warming flavor with a dry finish. Give Thanks!

<li>Dunkel Weizen
*** On Tap September 14th*** Cousin to Moweizen, the Dunkelweizen has the similar fruity characters from the Hefeweizen yeast strain such as vanilla, clove and banana on top of a complex variety of roasted and caramelized barley-malts and a wheat base giving notes of chocolate, coffee, raisin and plum.
