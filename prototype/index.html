<h2>Our Brewhouse</h2>

<p>The brewhouse consists of a 7BBL boil kettle, custom mashtun, and 6 7BBL fermenters.</p>

<h2>Our Tap Room</h2>

<p>The Hopps House Tap Room was designed and built with craft beer in mind. We hope our guests find as much enjoyment as we do in gathering among friends and neighbors over a pint of beer.

Visit our tap room and see what’s on tap! Enjoy a fresh beer by the pint or a sampler glass. After you’ve decided which is your favorite beer, bring home a growler!
See what we have on tap and bring a half-gallon growler of beer home to enjoy. Bring in your growler for a re-fill, or buy a new one for $7.</p>
